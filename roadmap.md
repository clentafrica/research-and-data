   - Study how women can become key agents in renewable energy adoption and climate technology through economic empowerment and leadership roles.

3. **Disability and Climate Vulnerability**
   - Analyze how people with disabilities face unique challenges in adapting to climate change and accessing renewable energy solutions.
   - Focus on inclusive climate technology design that caters to the needs of people with disabilities.

4. **Children and Climate Resilience**
   - Investigate how climate change affects children’s access to education, health, and general well-being.
   - Study the potential of renewable energy to improve living conditions for children in vulnerable and off-grid communities.

## Research Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundation and Data Collection (Q4 2024 – Q2 2025)**

#### **Objective**: Build a strong data foundation and set the stage for in-depth research.

1. **Environmental Health Baseline Study**:
   - Collect baseline data on air, water, and soil quality in key regions impacted by climate change.
   - Examine how pollution and environmental degradation impact public health, focusing on women, children, and people with disabilities.

2. **Women and Renewable Energy Access Survey**:
   - Conduct a survey to assess barriers women face in accessing and adopting renewable energy technologies.
   - Identify opportunities for economic empowerment through renewable energy jobs.

3. **Climate and Disability Vulnerability Mapping**:
   - Map regions where people with disabilities are most vulnerable to climate risks (e.g., extreme weather, droughts, flooding).
   - Partner with local organizations to identify specific needs for climate adaptation.

4. **Children and Climate Impact Study**:
   - Gather data on how climate change is affecting children’s health, education, and social development.
   - Explore the potential for renewable energy to enhance educational access in off-grid communities.

#### **Milestones**:
- Establish partnerships with local organizations and academic institutions.
- Create initial data repositories for environmental health, women, disability, and children.
- Develop survey instruments and data collection protocols.

### **Phase 2: In-Depth Analysis and Policy Recommendations (Q3 2025 – Q1 2026)**

#### **Objective**: Analyze collected data to generate actionable insights and policy recommendations.

1. **Environmental Health and Renewable Energy**:
   - Analyze the links between environmental health outcomes and the adoption of renewable energy.
   - Explore how clean energy solutions can mitigate pollution and improve public health, especially for women and children in vulnerable areas.

2. **Empowering Women in Climate Tech**:
   - Analyze the impact of renewable energy and climate tech on women’s economic empowerment.
   - Identify key drivers and obstacles for women entering the climate tech workforce.
   - Develop policy recommendations to enhance women’s leadership in climate-related sectors.

3. **Inclusive Climate Adaptation for People with Disabilities**:
   - Use the data from the vulnerability mapping to develop inclusive climate adaptation strategies.
   - Collaborate with technology developers to advocate for climate tech designs that meet the needs of people with disabilities.

4. **Building Climate Resilience for Children**:
   - Investigate the role of climate-resilient infrastructure (e.g., solar-powered schools, clean water solutions) in improving children’s education and health.
   - Formulate policy recommendations on how governments and NGOs can prioritize child-focused climate adaptation.

#### **Milestones**:
- Publish policy briefs and reports on each focus area.
- Hold stakeholder workshops to share findings and recommendations.
- Advocate for gender-sensitive and disability-inclusive climate policies.

---

### **Phase 3: Technology Integration and Pilot Projects (Q2 2026 – Q4 2026)**

#### **Objective**: Implement pilot programs that integrate research insights into real-world solutions.

1. **Environmental Health Tech Pilots**:
   - Launch pilot projects to deploy renewable energy technologies (e.g., solar-powered air and water purification systems) in communities with poor environmental health.
   - Monitor and report on the improvements in air and water quality and their effects on women’s and children’s health.

2. **Women-Led Climate Tech Initiatives**:
   - Implement women-led renewable energy startups and climate tech incubators.
   - Provide training, mentorship, and financial support to female entrepreneurs in climate tech.

3. **Disability-Inclusive Climate Tech Solutions**:
   - Develop and pilot adaptive climate technologies tailored to people with disabilities.
   - Ensure these technologies are tested in vulnerable regions identified in previous phases.

4. **Solar-Powered Schools for Children**:
   - Partner with local governments to pilot solar-powered schools in rural, off-grid areas.
   - Measure the impact on children’s access to education and overall well-being.

#### **Milestones**:
- Implement at least 3 pilot projects in renewable energy and environmental health.
- Gather impact data from pilot projects and refine strategies for scale-up.
- Develop blueprints for scaling successful pilots across multiple regions in Africa.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### **1. Data-Driven Decision Making**
   - Ensure all research is supported by robust data collection and analysis, with attention to data quality and transparency.
   - Use data to inform advocacy efforts, particularly in influencing local, national, and international climate policies.

### **2. Gender and Disability Mainstreaming**
   - Embed gender and disability perspectives into every phase of the research.
   - Promote the inclusion of women and people with disabilities as key stakeholders and decision-makers in climate resilience efforts.

### **3. Collaboration and Partnerships**
   - Collaborate with governments, NGOs, academic institutions, and private sector stakeholders to enhance the scope and impact of the research.
   - Ensure that pilot projects and interventions are scalable and sustainable through these partnerships.

### **4. Communication and Advocacy**
   - Regularly publish research findings and share insights with relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, media, and the public.
   - Use the data and insights to advocate for inclusive, sustainable policies in the context of climate change, renewable energy, and environmental health.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

The progress of this roadmap will be monitored through quarterly reviews and annual evaluations. Key performance indicators (KPIs) will include:
- Number of publications and policy briefs produced.
- Impact of pilot projects on women, children, and people with disabilities.
- Engagement and feedback from stakeholders, including local communities and policymakers.
- Adoption of inclusive climate policies as a result of advocacy efforts.

--- 

### Key Points:
- The roadmap spans **three research phases**: Data Collection, In-Depth Analysis, and Pilot Projects.
- The focus is on **vulnerable populations**: women, children, and people with disabilities.
- Each phase is structured to **inform policy**, **build capacity**, and **implement solutions** with renewable energy and climate technology.


## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a comprehensive guide for CLENT Africa’s research and data team to focus on the intersection of environmental health, gender equality, disability, and children in relation to climate change, renewable energy, and climate tech. By following this roadmap, we aim to produce meaningful research that drives both policy changes and real-world solutions to improve the lives of vulnerable populations across Africa.
